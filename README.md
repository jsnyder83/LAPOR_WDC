# LAPOR! Tableau Web Data Connector

This project builds on the work done by the Ex Libris Analytics project([Alma](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/Alma_Online_Help_(English)/Analytics) or Primo) with [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/) [Desktop](http://www.tableau.com/products/desktop). 

This Web Data Connector is an attempt to connect to the LAPOR! API to access data in in Tableau. 

Fill in your LAPOR! API Token, select a dataset, and the data stream (summary vs. detailed)

## To Use
You'll need the following to use the connector:
1. An API token from KSP. See http://blog.lapor.go.id to request an API Token.
2. You will also need a static IP that is whitelisted with KSP.
